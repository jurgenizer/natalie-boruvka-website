body: Throughout my studies towards a BTech Interior Design, I was constantly fascinated by the process that escalated an idea from the conceptual stage to realisation. Today I craft stories that share the creative journeys of others. As well as writing for some of the countryâ€™s leading design and decor publications, I source content, co-ordinate and style photo shoots and compile product editorials.
